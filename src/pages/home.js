            <br/>When I was in the hospital in 2022, I began crocheting and at the same time, looking into website development. Now that my health is not a concern and I have returned to school, I decided to combine these two things by creating an ecommerce site.
            <br/>I started this site on October 15th, 2024, the <a href="https://github.com/claireyy16/ecommerce-site">github repo</a> can be found here :)
