# Hi and welcome to my crochet site/React playground

I picked up both crocheting and website development while bored at the hospital, so why not  combine them together!
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# site deployment

I deployed this site originally on Vercel but switched to Netlify. Site can be found at this link:

# thank you for stopping by :)
